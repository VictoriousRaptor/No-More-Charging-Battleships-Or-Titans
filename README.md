## Why Do I Create This Mod

Recently when I came back to play Stellaris, I noticed that there is ALWAYS a single battleship charging forward like a fool, leaving others behind. If there's a titan, then it is its turn to charge. See the following pic.

I RECOGNIZED this bug. It can be traced back to version 1.3, which was released in **Oct 2016**. YES, **FOR MORE THAN FIVE BLOODY YEARS**, Paradox hasn't fix it yet.

This bug is related to the Artillery ship behavior, and actually quite easy to fix. Here's the patched result, now all ships with artillery ai will stay at range.

## New Ship Behaviors

To maximize X-slot and T-slot weapons's long range firepower, I create a new ship computers called 'Sniping'. Sniping computer is available for battleships, titans and juggernauts, making them to stay at their maximum weapon range.

## Compatibility

This mode overwrites the vanilla artillery ship behavior.

Not achievement compatible.
